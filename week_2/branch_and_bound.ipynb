    "Branch and bound (BB, B&B, or BnB) is an algorithm design paradigm for discrete and combinatorial optimization problems, as well as mathematical optimization. A branch-and-bound algorithm consists of a systematic enumeration of candidate solutions by means of state space search: the set of candidate solutions is thought of as forming a rooted tree with the full set at the root. The algorithm explores branches of this tree, which represent subsets of the solution set. Before enumerating the candidate solutions of a branch, the branch is checked against upper and lower estimated bounds on the optimal solution, and is discarded if it cannot produce a better solution than the best one found so far by the algorithm [[wiki]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_and_bound).\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition is simple, given three items I have to choose which one I want to keep and which one I want to discard. This lead to $2^{3}$ possible configurations that can be represented as a tree.\n",

    "The idea is to explore this tree, looking to those configurations that can be good candidates for the optimal solution. If I am able to discard most of the branches then I can effectively move on the tree and save time."

    "We can think of using **depth-first search (DFS)** on the tree generated by this problem. The **root node** has two associated numbers. The first is the maximum estimated value, in our example this value is $45+48+35 = 128$. The second is the maximum capacity of the knapsack, in our example 10. From each node we have two possibilities, to take the item or to discard it. If we **discard** the item the maximum value is decreased and the capacity is increased in the next node. If we **take** the item the maximum value is increased and the capacity is decreased. For instance, if we decide to discard the first item, we get a new maximum value $128 - 45 = 83$ whereas the capacity is increased (since the capacity is already maximal it cannot be increased more than that). Following this reasoning we end up with the following tree:\n",

    "Using this new formulation of the problem we can now rethink the **greedy strategy**. We can choose all the items until the limit of knapsack is reached, the leftover can be filled with a *fraction* of the next item. In our concrete example showed above we can choose item 3 and 1, reaching a weight of 8. We cannot put item 2 because its weight is 8 and taking it we will pass the limit of 10. We can take a portion of it! In our case we can take 1/4 of 8 that is 2, this weight fills the knapsack. The total value for this combination is 92.\n",
